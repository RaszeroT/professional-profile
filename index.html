          Hi my name is Travis Shanhun (Shannon), I am currently taking a new direction in my career. Coming from humble beginnings, I have taken leaps forward in trying to keep up with the direction the world is moving in. Moving from city to city as a young teen, I have seen the world for what it is, and the direction I need to move in to grow with it. As the world moves more and more into tech I have always wanted to ride that wave. Starting on my own by watching tutorials on youtube and using code academy, I eventually enrolled in the University of Kansas City (KU) online coding bootcamp; to give more structure, resources, and instruction to my learning.

	
          As a novice, full stack web developer I am passionate about growing in every sense. While hardcoding html files and making a polished user interface with CSS is entertaining and leaves you with an immediate sense of accomplishment. I prefer to dive into the more challenging, logical thought. Logical thought is something that he has found challenging from the very beginning and would jump at the opportunity to shadow a more experienced coder to not only get better at logical thought but to master it. I want to be a part of the next big thing and will stop at nothing to get there. The reason for this, coming from an education lacking background, I have always felt that I can be better, smarter, and bigger than the day before. I believe that sticking only to what you know and what is easy, would eventually become boring or non-challenging. 
        
          Coming from a blue collar background, my biggest accomplishments to date, would have to be the matter of first coming to the United States and attaining his GED. Following, being the first in my family to further education to a college level. And finally attending the KU coding bootcamp and furthering my knowledge as a web developer. We can save the “Software Engineer” title for a later date. 
        
        As mentioned before, I would jump at the opportunity to further my knowledge of the coding world by shadowing an experienced coder and having that chance to code myself and become a part of something bigger. Even if it's only a small part to begin with.
